Overview :

This project is a simulation of a macroprocessor implemented in C++ utilizing a stack data structure. The macroprocessor emulates basic arithmetic operations by pushing values onto the stack, popping values from the stack, and executing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the stack contents.

Key Features : 

Push values onto the stack
Pop values from the stack
Perform arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
